# Why Vextabit supports only DEXes?

Vextabit engineered to work outside the traditional finance layer and therefore doesn't integrate any financial services that operate on traditional finance ecosystems. Thus, there is no option to buy cryptocurrency using credit card (or bank deposit), or exchange cryptocurrency via traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (i.e. Binance, Coinbase etc).

To allow users to buy and sell one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency, Vextabit integrates the biggest decentralized exchanges which allow cryptocurrency trades outside the traditional finance layer. These exchanges are open and accessible 24/7 by anyone from anywhere.
