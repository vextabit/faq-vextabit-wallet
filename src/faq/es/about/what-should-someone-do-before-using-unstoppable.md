# What should someone do before using Vextabit?

Before doing anything on Vextabit you're strongly encouraged to go over the Academy section and get familiar with essential aspects of cryptocurrency and DeFi ecosystem.

The Academy was built to educate users looking to decentralize existing capital by investing into cryptocurrencies and the DeFi ecosystem. It covers all important aspects, from security fundamentals to DeFi opportunities.

The Academy goes well beyond covering basics and aims to:

- take someone from 'zero knowledge' to a level where that person has a solid understanding of how cryptocurrency storage, security and privacy works.
- onboard someone into the DeFi ecosystem, how it works, opportunities it provides and how to get started.

The Academy is accessible both from in-app as well as externally on https://litrex.academy.

Apart from Academy, users are recommended to go over Vextabit terms (Settings > About section) and make sure they understand what Vextabit wallet is and risks involved in using the app.
